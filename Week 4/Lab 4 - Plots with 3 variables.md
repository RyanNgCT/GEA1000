# Lab 4 - Plots with 3 variables
## Using Radiant for 3 variables
- creating a new variable to keep track of the treatment type and size of stone together.
- remember to change the variable types to `factor` prior to starting on the lab exercise.

1. Go to the `Transform` tab in Radiant
	1. Click **Create** from the `Transformation Type` dropdown
	2. Name the new variable `TS` which concatenates the variables together, delimited by a period (i.e. `X.Large`, `Y.Small` etc.).
		$TS = interaction(Treatment, Size)$

2. Go back to the **pivot tab** to create the pivot chart in Radiant
	1. Plot the Categorical variables of `TS` against `Outcome (factor)`
